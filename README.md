## 📌 Project Description

The **Intelligent Patient Risk Assessment System** is a machine learning–powered web application that predicts the likelihood of a patient having diabetes based on key medical vitals and demographic information. It uses a **Logistic Regression** model trained on the well-known Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset to deliver instant, probability-based risk assessments. The application is built with **Streamlit**, providing an intuitive and interactive interface that requires no technical knowledge to operate. This project demonstrates the end-to-end pipeline of an ML system — from data preprocessing and model training through to a fully deployed web interface.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

Follow these steps in your terminal, in order:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/patient-risk-assessment.git
cd patient-risk-assessment
```

### 2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # macOS / Linux
# venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
```

### 3. Install all dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Add the dataset
Download `diabetes.csv` and place it inside the `data/` folder:
```
patient-risk-assessment/data/diabetes.csv
```

### 5. Train and save the ML model
```bash
python model.py
```
This generates `model.pkl` and `scaler.pkl` in the project root.

### 6. Launch the Streamlit app
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
The app will open automatically at **http://localhost:8501**.

## 🧠 ML Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
The raw dataset contains biologically impossible zero values in columns such as `Glucose`, `BloodPressure`, `SkinThickness`, `Insulin`, and `BMI` — these represent missing data. All such zeros were replaced with `NaN` and then imputed with the **column median** (preferred over the mean due to its robustness against outliers). Features were then standardised using **`StandardScaler`** (zero mean, unit variance) to ensure no single feature dominates due to scale differences. The dataset was split **80% training / 20% testing** with `random_state=42` for full reproducibility.

### Model Choice — Logistic Regression
**Logistic Regression** was selected as the baseline model for this classification task because:
- It is highly interpretable and well-suited to binary classification problems.
- It produces calibrated probability outputs, allowing the app to show a meaningful **risk percentage**.
- It trains quickly and generalises well on moderately sized, tabular medical datasets.
- It serves as an excellent benchmark before exploring more complex models (e.g. Random Forest, XGBoost).

### Evaluation Metrics
| Metric | Why it was used |
|---|---|
| **Accuracy Score** | Overall correctness of predictions |
| **Precision & Recall** | Critical for imbalanced medical data — minimising false negatives (missed diagnoses) |
| **F1-Score** | Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall; balances both concerns |
| **Confusion Matrix** | Visual breakdown of TP, TN, FP, FN across both classes |
