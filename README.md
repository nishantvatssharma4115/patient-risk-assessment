## 📌 Overview

The **Intelligent Patient Risk Assessment System** is an end-to-end machine learning web application that predicts whether a patient is at risk of developing diabetes based on eight key clinical measurements. Built with Streamlit and Scikit-Learn, it provides instant probability-based risk assessments through an intuitive three-tab interface.

Users can either **upload their own patient dataset** (CSV or Excel) or use one of two **pre-built sample datasets** to explore the system immediately — no technical knowledge required.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This tool is for educational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- `git` installed

### Step-by-step

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nishantvatssharma4115/patient-risk-assessment.git
cd patient-risk-assessment
```

**2. Create and activate a virtual environment**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # macOS / Linux
# venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
```

**3. Install all dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Train and save the ML model**
```bash
python src/model.py
```
This generates `models/model.pkl` and `models/scaler.pkl` automatically.

**5. Launch the Streamlit app**
```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```

The app will open at **http://localhost:8501**

## 🧠 ML Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
The raw dataset contains biologically impossible zero values in `Glucose`, `BloodPressure`, `SkinThickness`, `Insulin`, and `BMI` — these represent missing measurements recorded as zeros. All such zeros are replaced with `NaN` and imputed using the **column median** (preferred over mean due to robustness against outliers). Features are then standardised using `StandardScaler` (zero mean, unit variance) to prevent large-scale features like Insulin from dominating the model. The dataset is split **80% training / 20% testing** with `random_state=42` for full reproducibility.

### Model — Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression was selected for the following reasons:
- Well-suited to **binary classification** (diabetic / non-diabetic)
- Produces **calibrated probability outputs** — powering the risk percentage display
- Highly **interpretable** — coefficients can be explained in plain English to stakeholders
- Strong baseline before exploring complex models (Random Forest, XGBoost)

### Results

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Accuracy | **75.32%** |
| Precision (Diabetes) | 0.67 |
| Recall (Diabetes) | 0.62 |
| F1-Score | 0.64 |
| RMSE | ~0.497 |
| MAE | ~0.247 |
| R² Score | ~0.01 |

### Confusion Matrix

|  | Predicted: No Diabetes | Predicted: Diabetes |
|---|---|---|
| **Actual: No Diabetes** | 82 ✅ (True Negative) | 17 ⚠️ (False Positive) |
| **Actual: Diabetes** | 21 ❌ (False Negative) | 34 ✅ (True Positive) |

> The 21 False Negatives (missed diagnoses) are the most consequential errors in a healthcare context — which is why **Recall** is prioritised alongside Accuracy.
